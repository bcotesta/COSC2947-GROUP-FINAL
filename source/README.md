# COLABORATION RULES
- ALWAYS BRANCH OUT when adding new features.
- Check with the entire group before you merge into main.
- Comment your name and the date at the top of every file.
- Make your code easy to read - Good comments and consistent variable names.
- Stray away from generative AI and copilot usage
